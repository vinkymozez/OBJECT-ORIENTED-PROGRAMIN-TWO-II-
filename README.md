## i. Object Modeling Techniques (OMT)

Object Modeling Techniques (OMT) is a method for modeling and designing systems using object-oriented concepts. Developed by James Rumbaugh, OMT is a part of the broader Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) methodology. It provides graphical notations for representing objects, classes, relationships, and other aspects of an object-oriented system.

## ii. Comparison between Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) and Object Analysis and Design (OOP)

Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) is a methodology encompassing both analysis and design phases. On the other hand, Object Analysis and Design (OOP) typically refer to the design phase only. In OOAD, the emphasis is on understanding the problem domain and defining system requirements using object-oriented concepts. In OOP, the focus is on designing the system architecture, classes, and interactions based on the analysis.

## iii. Main Goals of UML

Unified Modeling Language (UML) has several goals:

1. **Visual Modeling:** Provide a standard way to visualize a system using diagrams.
2. **Specification:** Specify the structure and behavior of a system.
3. **Documentation:** Document the design decisions and system architecture.
4. **Construction:** Aid in the construction and implementation of the system.
5. **Communication:** Facilitate communication among stakeholders.

## iv. Three Advantages of Using Object-Oriented to Develop an Information System

1. **Modularity:** OOP promotes modularity by encapsulating data and functionality within classes. This makes it easier to understand, maintain, and update code.
   
2. **Reuse:** OOP supports code reuse through inheritance and polymorphism. Existing classes can be extended or modified to create new classes, reducing redundancy.
   
3. **Flexibility and Scalability:** OOP provides flexibility by allowing the addition of new classes without affecting existing code. It also enhances scalability, making it easier to adapt systems to changing requirements.

## vi. Three Types of Associations (Relationships) Between Objects in Object-Oriented

1. **Association:** Represents a simple relationship between classes.
   
2. **Aggregation:** Denotes a "whole-part" relationship, where one class is composed of other classes.
   
3. **Composition:** Implies a stronger "whole-part" relationship, where the parts are entirely dependent on the whole.

## Vii. Class Diagram

A class diagram in UML is a static structural diagram that represents the structure of a system by showing the classes, their attributes, and relationships. It is used for visualizing, specifying, and documenting class-based systems.

**Steps to draw a class diagram:**

1. Identify classes based on the problem domain.
   
2. Determine the relationships between classes (association, aggregation, or composition).
   
3. Add attributes and methods to each class.
   
4. Draw the class diagram using UML notation.
